# Welcome to my attempt at making a user friendly CAD Program

It is currently being written in python, but it might be rewritten in a faster language like Go or C(++)

# Why?
Seeing as the options out there weren't all that friendly to new users in my opinion, or costed a lot of money, I decided on creating my own, new and friendly software,
hoping to compete with Fusion 360, FreeCAD and similiar programs.

# Contributing
Feel free to request features by opening an issue. You may also submit a pull request with a feature you implemented.

# Last but not least
I'm currently the only developer of this project and your help is gladly appreciated. Go ahead and do whatever you want with the code and the program itself.
Oh and, please report your bugs!
